# Multitool
This tool uses the Python libraries Textual and Pint to interpret a line of user input. It then shows conversions, calculations, and the option to search Google for the entered text.

## ...Why?
This isn't a well-polished piece of software, but it works well enough for me. I just wanted to mimic some of the functionality that Win10/11 have with the Start Menu search. I use it often for conversions and short calculations. This is just an alternative.
